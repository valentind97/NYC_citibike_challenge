### Summary:
In summary, if building a CitiBike business in Des Moines, the business should be scaled for a maximum utilization of 60K rides per month. Our analysis shows that the majority of riders are annual subscribers so we should make sure that annual subscriptions are priced to ensure profitability for the business. Another key observation is that most utilization of the NYC citibike program is for daily commuting to and from work. Given that the population density in Des Moines is lower than that of NYC, we should understand the average work commute distance for residents in Des Moines vs NYC.

Two additional analyses that should be performed with the existing data are:

age distribution of users. This will be important to match against age range of Des Moines residents.
start vs destination locations. Does the location distribution of bikes at the end of the day match the location distribution of bikes at the start of the day.
Two additional analyses that would require getting some additional data are:

profitability of annual subscriptions vs single use customer rides.
tourism rates between the two cities along with distance between tourist destinations in Des Moines. If locations of interest to Des Moines tourists are too far from each other, bikes may not be an attractive option for these customers.
